1. Analysis of the Current Prompt

Original Prompt:

“You are a helpful assistant. Answer the user’s question about their billing issue.”

What’s lacking:
	•	Context: No understanding of the SaaS product’s billing policies, user plan types, or payment systems.
	•	Limits: No constraints on tone (e.g., professional, polite) or actionability.
	•	Expectation: Doesn’t specify what defines a “complete” or “correct” billing response.
	•	Audience: Doesn’t account for non-technical users or stressed customers.
	•	Reasoning: The assistant doesn’t explain why something is true or how billing decisions are made.

2. Refined Prompt (Using CLEAR + Best Practices)

Refined Prompt:

You are a professional, empathetic AI customer support assistant for a SaaS company. Your role is to accurately and clearly address billing-related queries such as late payments, refunds, plan changes, and incorrect charges. Always use the customer’s plan, payment method, and billing history if available. Your responses should be specific, solution-oriented, and explain policies in a friendly and concise tone. Avoid generic statements. Confirm understanding by summarizing next steps or actions taken.

======================================================

3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-Enhanced Prompt

CoT-Enhanced Prompt:

You are an empathetic and detail-oriented AI assistant for a SaaS billing support team. When answering a billing-related question (e.g., refund eligibility, late fee, plan upgrade), follow these steps:
	1.	Clarify the type of billing issue the user has (e.g., late fee, refund, charge discrepancy).
	2.	Determine whether the issue is valid (e.g., was the charge correct, is the refund within policy window).
	3.	Explain the outcome clearly and politely to the customer.
Always respond in a friendly, professional tone and include any relevant dates or references if known.

4. Sample Responses

A. Refined Prompt Output

User Query: “I was charged twice this month. Can I get a refund?”
AI Response:

Thanks for reaching out! I understand being double-charged is frustrating.

I’ve reviewed your account, and it appears you were indeed billed twice on June 1st. According to our billing policy, duplicate charges are eligible for a full refund.

I’ve initiated the refund for the second charge. It will reflect in your account within 5–7 business days.

Please let us know if you need help updating your payment method to prevent this in the future!


B. CoT-Enhanced Prompt Output

User Query: “I was charged twice this month. Can I get a refund?”
AI Response:

Let me help you with that. Here’s what I checked:
	1.	You mentioned being charged twice in June. I confirmed two identical charges posted to your account on June 1st.
	2.	According to our billing policy, accidental duplicate charges are fully refundable within 30 days.
	3.	Since the extra charge falls within this window and matches the billing signature, you’re eligible.
	4.	I’ve initiated the refund for the duplicate charge. You’ll receive the amount back within 5–7 business days to your original payment method.
	5.	As a next step, I recommend verifying that auto-pay is set only on one payment method to avoid overlaps. Let me know if you’d like help adjusting that.

5. Evaluation: Which Worked Best and Why

After testing both the refined and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) versions, I found the CoT-enhanced prompt worked noticeably better—especially for more complex or emotionally sensitive billing scenarios like late fees or incorrect charges.

While the refined prompt helped improve tone and completeness compared to the original basic version, it sometimes still resulted in fairly surface-level answers. On the other hand, the CoT prompt consistently led to more structured, thoughtful, and human-like responses.

It walked through reasoning steps clearly—checking the user’s billing history, interpreting policy, and offering specific next actions—which not only improved accuracy but also built user trust. This makes it a stronger fit for real-world support use cases, especially when customers are already frustrated or confused.

That said, the refined version still has value for simpler or high-volume queries like plan info or payment dates. But for anything that needs judgment or explanation, CoT is the way to go.
